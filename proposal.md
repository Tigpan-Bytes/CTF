# Major Project Proposal

## Description
My major project is going to be a Capture the Flag (CTF) Hacking Competition. Hopefully taking place 1-3weeks before finals.
It consists of the repositories CTF, CTF_AI_BATTLE, and CTF_ENCRYPTOR_DECRYPTOR.
The CTF would take 1.5 - 3 hours, with many challenges and possibly an AI battle instead.
Teams should consist of 2-4 (5 and 1 may be allowed but not encouraged), even unexperienced people should be able to complete
some of the challenges and only the best should be able to do the most complicated. 

## Need To Have List
 - 4 Catagories of challenges Crypto, Forensics (A weird mixuture of actual forensics, exploitation, and web), Reverse, Prog
 - At least 4 challenges per catagory.
 - An SQL database to keep track of players, teams, and challenges completed.
 - A website to access the various challenges.
 - Login and Register portions of the site.
 - Scoreboard on the side of the website.
 - Being able to view how many and which challenges other teams have completed.
 - Unhackable Admin page for use by me during the CTF.
 
### Nessesary Challenges:
 - Crypto:
   - One challenge about caesar cipher.
   - One about a message encoded using a different base number system.
   - One about stegenography
   - One about a number encoded using math between different rgb values.
 - Forensics:
   - One challenge about looking through the code of a JS game to use a cheat code.
   - One about a corrupted jpgs that you need to open with note pad.
   - One about QR codes hidden in some pictures.
   - One about an SQL injection.
 - Reverse:
   - One simple challenge about reversing python.
   - One slightly more complicated challenge about reversing JS.
   - One about writing a program to brute force an encrypted password generated in C++.
   - One about reversing obfuscated JS.
 
## Nice To Have List
 - Instead of a Prog catagory do an AI competition.
   - The AI competitions will consist of every team submiting a Bot/AI. 
   Those Bots would fight every 15ish minutes, the winner and runners up would be awarded points.
   - The competition would also have generate a fair and equal map, that would would be fair for every player.
   - The competition will most likely be something like: every player starts with 2 bases and some units, units can step on resources to
   create more units, running into or attacking enemy units will hurt/kill them, steping on an enemy base will destroy it. Last team
   standing wins.
   - The participants would also be provided a copy of the program used to run the AI Battle so they can test their creations.
   - On the website there would also extensive documentation for the API given to the participants.
 - 5 challenges per catagory (The ones added would probably be on the easy side).
 - Sexy looking website for the CTF.
