# Before CTF

- I had Mr.Schellenberg briefly look over the AI Battle: 
Everything was good at that point
- I had Erik Frederiksen look over the entire CTF: 
Everything went well, he said good things about the AI Battle, he also recommended I change how the \<code> blocks are formatted for certain questions (this was changed).
He also recommended I add some additional trivia questions for the newbies to solve (I didn't have time to add this as he replied a day before the CTF and I disagreed with adding trivia questions).

# During CTF

- 30ish people came out in total.
- Everything went very well the only real problems were that it was hard for people to understand the AI Battle in the beginning, 
however once people started understanding they all enjoyed it and even crowded around the screen to watch each battle.
- There was also an issue where the AI-Battle starter kit couldn't be downloaded on chrome browsers (only tested on firefox as we changed how the starter kit would be downloaded last minute.) This was easily fixed by putting it in the school dropbox.
