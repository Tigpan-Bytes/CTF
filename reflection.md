# Hardest?

The hardest thing was in the AI-BATTLE and it was to create was allowing outside python files to be run while also 
protecting the main program against errors and getting stuck in a while true loop. This was solved it just took a while, 
it is also the thing I am most proud of.

# If I had to do it again?

I think everything worked pretty well, there is nothing that I 
would change except making some of the challenges slightly easier and better explaining the AI-BATTLE.
