# Major Project Proposal

## Description
My major project is going to be a Capture the Flag (CTF) Hacking Competition. Hopefully taking place 1-3weeks before finals.
It consists of the repositories CTF, CTF_AI_BATTLE, and CTF_ENCRYPTOR_DECRYPTOR.
The CTF would take 1.5 - 3 hours, with many challenges and possibly an AI battle instead.
Teams should consist of 2-4 (5 and 1 may be allowed but not encouraged), even unexperienced people should be able to complete
some of the challenges and only the best should be able to do the most complicated. 

## Need To Have List
 - 4 Catagories of challenges Crypto, Forensics (A weird mixuture of actual forensics, exploitation, and web), Reverse, Prog
 - At least 3 challenges per catagory.
 - An SQL database to keep track of players, teams, and challenges completed.
 - A website to access the various challenges.
 
## Nice To Have List
 - Instead of a Prog catagory do an AI competition.
   - The AI competitions will consist of every team submiting a Bot/AI. 
   Those Bots would fight every 15ish minutes, the winner and runners up would be awarded points.
   - The participants would also be provided a copy of the program used to run the AI Battle so they can test their creations.
   - On the website there would also extensive documentation for the API given to the participants.
 - 5 challenges per catagory.
 - Sexy looking website for the CTF.
